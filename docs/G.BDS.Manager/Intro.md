# G.DataManager

## 1. What Is This Tool?

**G.DataManager** is a standalone desktop application designed to help AEC professionals manage, standardize, and automate data extraction from BIM models using reusable configuration files and scheduling templates.  

At its core, G.DataManager acts as a **BDS Config Manager**—it enables users to create, open, edit, and export `.bds.config` files, which reference structured BDS templates. These templates define what data to extract from IFC-based models and how to format it, ensuring consistency across teams and projects.

Whether you're managing a single BIM model or coordinating multiple stakeholders on a large infrastructure project, G.DataManager gives you a visual and efficient way to control **how building data is captured, organized, and shared**.

## 2. What Is a BDS File?

### Building Data Share (BDS) Format

**Building Data Share (BDS)** is an open, XML-based schema designed for defining structured, reusable data schedules in BIM workflows.  

Built on the **IFC (Industry Foundation Classes)** standard, BDS enables cross-platform, multidisciplinary data templates that can be reused across multiple models, teams, and phases of a construction project.

Instead of manually defining what data you need from your BIM model, a BDS file allows you to:
- Specify IFC entities to include (e.g., `IfcWall`, `IfcDoor`)
- Choose which properties or attributes to extract (e.g., FireRating, Type, LoadBearing)
- Apply filters (e.g., `IsExternal = true`, `FireRating > 2 HR`)
- Define sorting rules and field visibility

This turns complex model data into clean, structured, and predictable tabular outputs ready for analysis, compliance checks, or export to Excel.

### Highlights

- **Standards-Based**  
  Built for interoperability with any software that supports IFC.

- **Reusable Templates**  
  Define once, reuse everywhere. Ensures consistency across all project stages and contributors.

- **Multi-Disciplinary Coverage**  
  Supports all disciplines including architecture, structural, mechanical, and electrical.

- **Structured Output**  
  Produces well-formed schedules with headers, metadata, and filters embedded in the definition.
